# Social-Network-Api

## Description

A simple api that can store users, posts or "thoughts", reactions to the posts and user friend lists. Using simple GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods you are able to get all of the stored data, post new data, update data and delete stored data. All of these functionalities are very common amongst today's social media applications and can be found on a variety of everyday websites as well. This api can be further developed to be able to process more data and have more ways for users to interact and add content.
